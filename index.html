    <h3>Adenoviruses in Gene Therapy and Vaccine Development</h3>
    <p>
      Adenoviruses are double stranded DNA non-enveloped viruses that are
      contained in an icosahedral capsid studded with fiber proteins on the
      vertices. The adenovirus particle is 70-90 nanometers in size, so it is
      far smaller than the average cell which is about 100,000 nanometers in
      diameter; yet it is still considered to be a medium sized virus.
      Adenoviruses were discovered in 1953 and there are more than 50 human
      serotypes that most commonly cause illness of the respiratory system, ie.
      the common cold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adenoviruses are easy to grow in the laboratory, maintain a high level of
      infectivity and are easy to genetically manipulate by inserting genes of
      interest into the viruses' double stranded DNA. Because of their defined
      replication cycle and features mentioned above, adenoviruses are often
      chosen to be the workhorses for gene therapy and vaccine development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gene therapy is a technique in which the gene of a patient is modified or
      replaced so that a disease-state is modified or eliminated. Gene therapy
      requires some vehicle to carry and insert the gene of choice that will
      change or replace the diseased gene into the patient's genome. Generally,
      this requires infecting a subset of cells in the body. To make the vectors
      for gene therapy, the viral genes of adenoviruses (who's genome typically
      containing 23-46 protein coding viral genes) are removed and the genes of
      interest to be expressed in the patient are introduced. To some extent
      this procedure limits the amount and size of genes of interest that are
      integrated into the modified adenoviral genome because the viral capsid's
      structure creates a hard limit on how much double stranded DNA can be
      introduced. Because many clinical trials have found that adenoviral
      vectors are safe and well tolerated in humans, adenoviral vectors have
      also been used in trials for the treatment of cancers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In vaccine development, it is important that the vaccine is safe,
      generates an antibody response, and it is also advantageous for the
      vaccine to elicit a T cell response in the patient. Antibodies can
      neutralize pathogens or alert the immune system to destroy a particular
      target. The next objective is to drive a strong T cell response to support
      antibody production or stimulate cytotoxic T cells to kill any pathogens
      that have evaded the antibodies. Adenoviral vectors have been chosen for
      vaccine development because it is easy to genetically engineer with genes
      for a particular virus threat. Also, a single replication competent
      adenovirus can create as many as 10,000 copies of itself from one viral
      particle. This amplifies the inserted viral genes that are important for
      creating the antibody and T cell responses. The downside of using
      adenoviral vectors in humans is that in immunocompromised patients, they
      may display more dangerous side effects from the adenovirus. This has been
      recently addressed though in the development of single-cycle adenovirus
      vectors. What this means is that normally an adenoviral vector not only
      makes 10,000 copies of it's genome, it also makes 10,000 viral particles
      that can infect other cells in the body. Single-cycle adenovirus vectors
      do not have that property so they only replicate the genes of interest
      (for example for the viral vaccine) in the infected cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, adenoviruses have been very useful for biological
      production because of their genetic tractability of their double stranded
      DNA genome and the evidence that most adenoviral vectors are safe and well
      tolerated in human patients. Their utility as drivers for foreign gene
      expression is highlighted in their uses in gene therapy and in vaccine
      development.
